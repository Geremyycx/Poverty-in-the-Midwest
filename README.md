# <b>Project Three: Poverty in the Midwest </b><br />

<ins><b>Description</ins></b><br />
This project aimed to identify the predictor variables that most significantly impact the rate of homelessness. We employed methods such as exploratory data analysis and factor analysis to develop a structural equation model, uncovering the relationships between our predictors and response variables.

<ins><b>Background</ins></b><br />
Our study focuses on 12 Midwest states: North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio. Within these states, we included every county, totaling 1,056 counties. This comprehensive sample size provides a robust representation of the broader U.S. population.

<ins><b>Objectives</ins></b><br />
- To identify key predictor variables affecting the rate of homelessness.
- To understand the relationships between these predictors and homelessness rates.
- To analyze the statistical relationships between various demographic, economic, and social variables and the rate of homelessness.

<ins><b>Exploratory Data Analysis</ins></b><br />
During our exploratory data analysis, we observed that the covariability varied across different pairs of dimensions. Given our large sample size, we identified numerous outliers. However, after removing these outliers, we found that their absence did not significantly impact our correlation plot.
